## Interests and Hobbies

First, let’s get this out of the way:
I am a furry <span class="dimmed">(yeah, I hope it’s obvious by now)</span>.
Furry is my hobby -- _or rather_ -- my lifestyle.
I have created a few original characters (OCs),
but <Bole/> is always gonna be my main fursona.

Speaking of being furry as a hobby,

- <span class="bright font-bold">Roleplay?</span>
  I’ve never tried roleplaying; it sounds horribly energy-consuming.
  Anyways, I’m always open to that if sufficiently motivated.
- <span class="bright font-bold">Art?</span>
  I’m no artist. I can’t draw, paint, sculpt -- I’m hopeless.
  But I adore art and admiring their creators.
  <span class="dimmed">\**ahem*\*</span> That’s why art commissioning exists.
- <span class="bright font-bold">Fursuiting?</span>
  I’m not ready to face such a huge commitment yet.
  It is huge investments -- not only the cost of the fursuit itself,
  but also the maintenance and logistics.
  I have huge respect for those who pursue this endeavor.
  And do I need to mention that it’s scorching hot inside a fursuit?
- <span class="bright font-bold">Conventions?</span>
  Yes! Although I’ve identified as a furry for a long time,
  I attended my first furry convention only recently.
  Furry conventions and events I went so far:
  ThaiTails&nbsp;2023, FurGet&nbsp;2023, Infurnity&nbsp;2023, and ThaiTails&nbsp;2024.
  <span class="dimmed">I’m looking forward to attending more conventions in the future.
  Please say hi if you see me there!</span>
- <span class="bright font-bold">Doujins? Merchandises?</span>
  I have a modest collection of approximately a hundred doujinshi <em class="dimmed">so far</em>,
  most of them furry-themed.
  Merchandise isn’t really my thing, especially acrylic items.
  On a different note, I’ve helped my [artist friend](https://www.facebook.com/Kalon.Ezhno)
  sell their furry stuff at events like FurSquare&nbsp;2023 and Infurnity&nbsp;2023.

### What else?

- I love listening to music and I go to great lengths
to attend concerts by my favorite musical artists.
On one occasion, I even traveled to Japan once solely for the concerts.
In total, I’ve made _four_ trips to Japan where concerts were my main purpose of visit.
- Speaking of my musical palette, I’m obsessed with J-Pop, anisongs, and anime soundtracks.
I can even sometimes identify the music composer of a new anime just by listening!
- Karaoke is my preferred method of practicing Japanese kana -- and
if you can withstand my horrible singing, I know a great Japanese karaoke spot
<span class="dimmed">(definitely _not_ Man****eko)</span>.
- I’m a big nerd, <span class="dimmed">_literally_ and _figuratively_</span>:
science, technology, linguistics, typography, photography, anime, games, quizzes,
riddles, brain teasers, cryptic clues -- you name it.
- Back in 2000s and 2010s, I used to binge a ton of anime.
Nowadays, I get my weeb fix from just a couple of good shows each season.
- TV game shows are my addiction of choice.
I’m a huge fan of UK quiz shows like
[Only Connect](http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Only_Connect_(2))
and [The Chase](http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/The_Chase)!
<span class="dimmed">You should check them out on YouTube.</span>
- I like to travel abroad and tread on off-beaten paths.
[Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/all-places-in-the-atlas-on-one-map)
is my preferred Travel Guide.
I’ve been spending at least one night at the following places <span class="dimmed">(in alphabetical order)</span>:
Australia, Bulgaria, China, Egypt, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Laos,
Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States.
I hope to continue exploring as my budget allows.
- I’m a dog person <span class="dimmed">(surprise, surprise)</span>.
I dream of having a fluffy poodle as my sidekick someday -- no, not a toy one.


## My Fursona

His name is <Bole />. Despite being a dog,
this auspicious name derives from the Middle English word for a young heraldic bull
and shares the pronunciation of <em>bull</em>.

<p class="dimmed mx-6 text-sm/6">
    For those linguistically inclined, here are some possible IPA transcriptions
    of the word:
    <span class="ipa">/ˈbul(ə)/</span>,
    <span class="ipa">/ˈbuːl(ə)/</span>,
    <span class="ipa">/ˈbɔːl(ə)/</span>&emsp;(see [pronunciation
    guide](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Middle_English_pronunciation))
</p>

His names holds a little-known story. <Bole /> was born prematurely, his body
frail and vulnerable to the slightest breeze. The doctor feared that he might
not survive. Concerned for his well-being, his mother chose a name inspired by
a bull to bestow strength and courage upon him. And that was how his name came
to be.

### Physical Traits

<Bole/> is a dog but with one striking feature:
a pair of protruding, sharp incisors commonly mistaken for a rabbit.
His belly, albeit being soft, has the solid roundness matching a noble hound.
His soft pelage consists of _four_ primary colors:
<span class="text-beetroot-500">Beetroot</span>,
<span class="text-orange-300">Orange</span>,
<span class="text-lemon-400">Lemon</span>, and
<span class="text-eggplant-500">Eggplant</span>.
