The character has an open-mouthed smile, showing white teeth and a normal-colored tongue, with orange face paint markings on its cheeks. Its right arm is raised in a thumbs-up gesture. Behind the character are light pink cloud shapes. To the left, text reads "That Charming BOLE" in purple, followed by some non-descriptive text in light pink. Below that is "https://bolepen.ooo" the URL of the website. The background is a light pink with a subtle pattern of vertical dashed lines.',
