## My Fursona


### Name, and the Story Behind It

His name is <Bole />, <Bole style="full-emphasized" />.
Despite being a dog, this auspicious name derives from the Middle English word
for a young heraldic bull and shares the pronunciation of <em>bull</em>.

<Smaller>
  For those linguistically inclined,
  here are some possible IPA transcriptions of the word:
  <IPATranscript>/ˈbul(ə)/</IPATranscript>,
  <IPATranscript>/ˈbuːl(ə)/</IPATranscript>,
  <IPATranscript>/ˈbɔːl(ə)/</IPATranscript>&emsp;(see
  [pronunciation guide](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Middle_English_pronunciation))

His name holds a little-known origin story.
<Bole /> was born prematurely, his body frail and vulnerable to the slightest breeze.
The doctor feared that he might not survive.
Concerned for his well-being,
his mother chose a name inspired by a bull to bestow strength and courage upon him.
And that was how his name came to be.

**Message from the Creator.** The moniker
<Bole style="full" /> was often stylized as <Bole style="handle" /> in internet handles,
reflecting Middle English spelling practices.


### Physical Traits

<Bole/> is a dog but with one striking feature:
a pair of protruding, sharp incisors commonly mistaken for a rabbit.
His chubby belly, albeit being soft, has the solid roundness matching a noble hound.
His soft pelage consists of _four_ primary colors:
<span class="px-px text-beetroot-500 bg-black">Beetroot</span>,
<span class="px-px text-orange-300 bg-black">Orange</span>,
<span class="px-px text-lemon-400 bg-black">Lemon</span>, and
<span class="px-px text-eggplant-500 bg-black">Eggplant</span>.

**Message from the Creator.** Despite being anatomically chubby most time of the year,
<Bole/> can transform into other shapes (e.g. buff, lean, or anything in between)
with the magical power of <Highlight>commissioned artworks</Highlight>.

### Furry Code

[Developed in the 1990s by Ross Smith](https://www.captainpackrat.com/furry/furcode.htm),
Furry Code is a way to represent a furry’s interests and personality in a concise format.
Following the tradition, below is my Furry Code:

<LigatureSettings feature="none">
```rfc7468 frame=none
-----BEGIN FURRY CODE BLOCK-----
FCM3asw A->++ C+ D? H+++ M? P- R- T+++ W? Z? Sm- RLCT a+ cl++ e+++ f- h++ iwf++ j++ p- sm++
-----END FURRY CODE BLOCK-----
```
</LigatureSettings>

### Sport Jerseys

I have a deep admiration for sports and athletes for their display of strength and tenacity.
To prepare myself of becoming one someday, I have started collecting sport jerseys.
The inaugural piece is from the Kemono Baseball Team clothing line, and I proudly wear number **90&hairsp;&NoBreak;TH**.
Stay tuned for more additions to my collection as my budget allows.
