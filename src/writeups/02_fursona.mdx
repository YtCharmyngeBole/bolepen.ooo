## My Fursona

### Name, and the Story Behind It

His name is <span class="bole">BOLE</span>,
<span class="bole">*That* Charming BOLE</span>.
Despite being a dog, this auspicious name derives from the Middle English word
for a young heraldic bull and shares the pronunciation of <em>bull</em>.

<div class="smallnote">
  For those linguistically inclined, here are some possible IPA transcriptions
  of the word:
  <span class="ipa">/ˈbul(ə)/</span>,<span class="ipa">/ˈbuːl(ə)/</span>,
  <span class="ipa">/ˈbɔːl(ə)/</span> (see [pronunciation guide](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Middle_English_pronunciation))
</div>

His name holds a little-known origin story.
<span class="bole">BOLE</span> was born prematurely, his body frail and
vulnerable to the slightest breeze. The doctor feared that he might not survive.
Concerned for his well-being, his mother chose a name inspired by a bull to
bestow strength and courage upon him. And that was how his name came to be.

**Message from the Creator.** The moniker
<span class="bole">That Charming BOLE</span> was often stylized as
<span class="bole before:content-[open-quote] after:content-[close-quote]"><span class="px-px">YtCharmyngeBole</span></span>
in internet handles, reflecting Middle English spelling practices.

### Physical Traits

<span class="bole">BOLE</span> is a dog but with one striking feature: a pair of
protruding, sharp incisors commonly mistaken for a rabbit. His chubby belly,
albeit being soft, has the solid roundness matching a noble hound. His soft
pelage consists of *four* primary colors:
<span class="px-px text-beetroot bg-black">Beetroot</span>,
<span class="px-px text-orange bg-black">Orange</span>,
<span class="px-px text-lemon bg-black">Lemon</span>, and
<span class="px-px text-eggplant bg-black">Eggplant</span>.

**Message from the Creator.** Despite being anatomically chubby most time of the year,
<span class="bole">BOLE</span> can transform into other shapes (e.g. buff, lean,
or anything in between) with the magical power of *commissioned artworks*.

### Furry Code

[Developed in the 1990s by Ross Smith](https://www.captainpackrat.com/furry/furcode.htm),
Furry Code is a way to represent a furry’s interests and personality in a concise format.
Following the tradition, below is my Furry Code:

<IosevkaLigature feature="none">
  ```rfc7468 frame=none
  -----BEGIN FURRY CODE BLOCK-----
  FCM3asw A->++ C+ D?
  H+++ M? P- R- T+++ W? Z? Sm- RLCT a+ cl++ e+++ f- h++ iwf++ j++ p- sm++
  -----END FURRY CODE BLOCK-----
  ```
</IosevkaLigature>

### Sport Jerseys

I have a deep admiration for sports and athletes for their display of strength and tenacity.
To prepare myself of becoming one someday, I have started collecting sport jerseys.
The inaugural piece is from the Kemono Baseball Team clothing line, and I proudly wear number **90 ⁠TH**.
Stay tuned for more additions to my collection as my budget allows.
