<span class="text-xl">H</span><span class="text-lg">i</span>,
my name is <span class="bole">BOLE</span>,
a rodent doggo¬†üê∂ who loves lying in bed while enjoying some belly rubs.
Born in the beautiful city of Phuket but now live in Bangkok, Thailand.
Welcome to my <em class="brighter-80">bolepen</em>!

Feel free to reach out and say hi! I'm always excited to meet new friends
<span class="muted">(furry or otherwise)</span>.
And please¬†üòñ offer to cuddle me if you happen to meet me in person.


## Hobbies and Interests

First, let‚Äôs get this out of the way: **I am a furry**
<span class="muted">(yeah, I hope it‚Äôs obvious by now)</span>.
Furry is my hobby <span class="muted">‚Äâ--‚Äâ*or rather*‚Äâ--‚Äâ</span>my lifestyle.
I‚Äôve created a few original characters (OCs),
but <span class="bole">BOLE</span> is always gonna be my main fursona.

Speaking of being furry as a hobby,

- **Roleplay?**
  Never tried it. It sounds horribly energy-consuming.
  But I‚Äôm always open to that if sufficiently motivated.
- **Art?**
  I‚Äôm no good at anything: drawing, painting, sculpting‚Äâ--‚ÄâI‚Äôm hopeless.
  But I adore art and admiring their creators.
  <span class="muted">\**ahem*\*</span>
  That‚Äôs why art commissioning exists.
- **Fursuiting?**
  Huge commitment, huge investment, huge logistic and maintenance burden, so no.
  Though I have huge respect for those who pursue this endeavor,
  that they have to do it in scorching heat inside a fursuit.
- **Conventions?**
  Yes! Although I‚Äôve identified as a furry for a long time,
  I attended my first furry convention only recently.
  [See here for past attendance.](#social-gatherings)
  <span class="muted">Hope to see you at the next one!</span>
- **Doujins? Merchandises?**
  I maintain a modest collection of approximately a hundred furry doujinshi
  <span class="muted">(so far)</span>, most of them furry-themed. Other kinds of
  merchandise aren‚Äôt really my thing, especially acrylic items. On a different
  note, I‚Äôve helped my [artist friend](https://www.facebook.com/Kalon.Ezhno)
  sell their furry stuff at events like FurSquare¬†2023 and Infurnity¬†2023.

### What else?

- I love listening to music and I go to great lengths
  to attend concerts by my favorite musical artists.
  On one occasion, I even traveled to Japan once solely for the concerts.
  In total, I‚Äôve made *four* trips to Japan where concerts were my main purpose of visit.
- Speaking of my musical palette, I‚Äôm obsessed with J-Pop, anisongs, and anime soundtracks.
  I can even sometimes identify the music composer of a new anime just by listening!
- Karaoke is my preferred method of practicing Japanese kana‚Äâ--‚Äâand
  if you can withstand my horrible singing,
  I know a great Japanese karaoke spot
  <span class="muted">(definitely *not* Man\*\*\*\*eko)</span>.
- I‚Äôm a big nerd <span class="muted">(*literally* and *figuratively*)</span>:
  science, technology, linguistics, typography, photography, anime, games,
  quizzes, riddles, brain-teasers, cryptic clues‚Äâ--‚Äâyou name it.
- Back in 2000s and 2010s, I used to binge a ton of anime.
  Nowadays, I get my weeb fix from just a couple of good shows each season.
- TV game shows are my addiction of choice.
  I‚Äôm a huge fan of UK quiz shows like
  [Only Connect](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Only_Connect_\(2\))
  and [The Chase](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/The_Chase),
  or a little more cheeky one like [Taskmaster](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Taskmaster).
  <span class="muted">All highly recommended! Definitely check them out on YouTube.</span>
- I like to travel abroad and tread on off-beaten paths.
  [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/all-places-in-the-atlas-on-one-map)
  is my preferred Travel Guide.
  I‚Äôve been spending at least one night at the following places
  <span class="muted">(in alphabetical order)</span>: Australia, Bulgaria,
  China, Egypt, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,
  United Kingdom, and United States. I hope to continue exploring as my budget
  allows.
- I‚Äôm a dog person <span class="muted">(surprise, surprise)</span>.
  I dream of having a fluffy poodle as my sidekick someday‚Äâ--‚Äâno, not a toy one.


## My Fursona

### Name, and the Story Behind It

His name is <span class="bole">BOLE</span>,
<span class="bole">*That* Charming BOLE</span>.
Despite being a dog, this auspicious name derives from the Middle English word
for a young heraldic bull and shares the pronunciation of <em>bull</em>.

<div class="smallnote">
  For those linguistically inclined, here are some possible IPA transcriptions
  of the word:
  <span class="ipa">/Ààbul(…ô)/</span>,<span class="ipa">/ÀàbuÀêl(…ô)/</span>,
  <span class="ipa">/Ààb…îÀêl(…ô)/</span> (see [pronunciation
  guide](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Middle_English_pronunciation))
</div>

His name holds a little-known origin story.
<span class="bole">BOLE</span> was born prematurely, his body frail and
vulnerable to the slightest breeze. The doctor feared that he might not survive.
Concerned for his well-being, his mother chose a name inspired by a bull to
bestow strength and courage upon him. And that was how his name came to be.

**Message from the Creator.**‚ÄÇThe moniker
<span class="bole">That Charming BOLE</span> was often stylized as
<span class="bole before:content-[open-quote] after:content-[close-quote]"><span class="px-px">YtCharmyngeBole</span></span>
in internet handles, reflecting Middle English spelling practices.

### Physical Traits

<span class="bole">BOLE</span> is a dog but with one striking feature: a pair of
protruding, sharp incisors commonly mistaken for a rabbit. His chubby belly,
albeit being soft, has the solid roundness matching a noble hound. His soft
pelage consists of *four* primary colors:
<span class="px-px text-beetroot not-print:bg-black">Beetroot</span>,
<span class="px-px text-orange not-print:bg-black">Orange</span>,
<span class="px-px text-lemon not-print:bg-black">Lemon</span>, and
<span class="px-px text-eggplant not-print:bg-black">Eggplant</span>.

**Message from the Creator.**‚ÄÇDespite being anatomically chubby most time of the year,
<span class="bole">BOLE</span> can transform into other shapes (e.g. buff, lean,
or anything in between) with the magical power of *commissioned artworks*.

### Personal Preferences

These are my personal preferences pertaining to my fursona:

- **Favorite food:**‚ÄÇChicken thighs and drumsticks; Beef; People inside BEEF
- **Favorite color:**‚ÄÇGreen‚ÄÇ<span class="muted">(who would‚Äôve guessed?)</span>
- **Hobbies:**‚ÄÇLying around, Belly rubs, and Working out <span class="muted">(or at least immensely thinking about it)</span>
- **Likes:**‚ÄÇ3 M‚Äôs: Music, Munchies, and Mad calves
- **Dislikes:**‚ÄÇSense of impending doom

### Furry Code

[Developed in the 1990s by Ross Smith](https://www.captainpackrat.com/furry/furcode.htm),
Furry Code is a way to represent a furry‚Äôs interests and personality in a concise format.
Following the tradition, below is my Furry Code:

<IosevkaLigature feature="none">
  ```rfc7468 title="bole.furrycode.txt"
  -----BEGIN FURRY CODE BLOCK-----
  FCM3asw A->++ C+ D? H+++ M? P- R- T+++ W? Z? Sm-
  RLCT a+ cl++ e+++ f- h++ iwf++ j++ p- sm++
  -----END FURRY CODE BLOCK-----
  ```
</IosevkaLigature>

  Code](https://mj.ucw.cz/furry/?code=FCM3asw+A-%3e%2b%2b+C%2b+D%3f+H%2b%2b%2b+M%3f+P-+R-+T%2b%2b%2b+W%3f+Z%3f+Sm-+RLCT+a%2b+cl%2b%2b+e%2b%2b%2b+f-+h%2b%2b+iwf%2b%2b+j%2b%2b+p-+sm%2b%2b)

### Sport Jerseys

I have a deep admiration for sports and athletes for their display of strength and tenacity.
To prepare myself of becoming one someday, I have started collecting sport jerseys.
The inaugural piece is from the Kemono Baseball Team clothing line, and I proudly wear number **90‚Ää‚Å†TH**.
Stay tuned for more additions to my collection as my budget allows.
