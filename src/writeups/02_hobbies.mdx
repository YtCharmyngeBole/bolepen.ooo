## Hobbies and Interests

First, let’s get this out of the way:
**I am a furry** <Mute>(yeah, I hope it’s obvious by now)</Mute>.
Furry is my hobby -- _or rather_ -- my lifestyle.
I’ve created a few original characters (OCs),
but <Bole /> is always gonna be my main fursona.

Speaking of being furry as a hobby,

- <Highlight>Roleplay?</Highlight>
  Never tried it. It sounds horribly energy-consuming.
  But I’m always open to that if sufficiently motivated.
- <Highlight>Art?</Highlight>
  I’m no good at anything: drawing, painting, sculpting -- I’m hopeless.
  But I adore art and admiring their creators.
  <Mute>\**ahem*\*</Mute> That’s why art commissioning exists.
- <Highlight>Fursuiting?</Highlight>
  Huge commitment, huge investment, huge logistic and maintenance burden, so no.
  Though I have huge respect for those who pursue this endeavor,
  that they have to do it in scorching heat inside a fursuit.
- <Highlight>Conventions?</Highlight>
  Yes! Although I’ve identified as a furry for a long time,
  I attended my first furry convention only recently.
  **Past events:**
  ThaiTails&nbsp;2023, FurGet&nbsp;2023, Infurnity&nbsp;2023, and ThaiTails&nbsp;2024.
  <Mute>Hope to see you at the next one!</Mute>
- <Highlight>Doujins? Merchandises?</Highlight>
  I maintain a modest collection of approximately a hundred furry doujinshi
  <Mute>(so far)</Mute>, most of them furry-themed.
  Other kinds of merchandise aren’t really my thing, especially acrylic items.
  On a different note, I’ve helped my [artist friend](https://www.facebook.com/Kalon.Ezhno)
  sell their furry stuff at events like FurSquare&nbsp;2023 and Infurnity&nbsp;2023.


### What else?

- I love listening to music and I go to great lengths
  to attend concerts by my favorite musical artists.
  On one occasion, I even traveled to Japan once solely for the concerts.
  In total, I’ve made _four_ trips to Japan where concerts were my main purpose of visit.
- Speaking of my musical palette, I’m obsessed with J-Pop, anisongs, and anime soundtracks.
  I can even sometimes identify the music composer of a new anime just by listening!
- Karaoke is my preferred method of practicing Japanese kana -- and
  if you can withstand my horrible singing,
  I know a great Japanese karaoke spot
  <Mute>(definitely _not_ Man****eko)</Mute>.
- I’m a big nerd <Mute>(_literally_ and _figuratively_)</Mute>:
  science, technology, linguistics, typography, photography, anime, games,
  quizzes, riddles, brain-teasers, cryptic clues -- you name it.
- Back in 2000s and 2010s, I used to binge a ton of anime.
  Nowadays, I get my weeb fix from just a couple of good shows each season.
- TV game shows are my addiction of choice.
  I’m a huge fan of UK quiz shows like
  [Only Connect](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Only_Connect_(2))
  and [The Chase](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/The_Chase),
  or a little more cheeky one like [Taskmaster](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Taskmaster).
  <Mute>All highly recommended! Definitely check them out on YouTube.</Mute>
- I like to travel abroad and tread on off-beaten paths.
  [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/all-places-in-the-atlas-on-one-map)
  is my preferred Travel Guide.
  I’ve been spending at least one night at the following places
  <Mute>(in alphabetical order)</Mute>:
  Australia, Bulgaria, China, Egypt, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Laos,
  Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States.
  I hope to continue exploring as my budget allows.
- I’m a dog person <Mute>(surprise, surprise)</Mute>.
  I dream of having a fluffy poodle as my sidekick someday -- no, not a toy one.
