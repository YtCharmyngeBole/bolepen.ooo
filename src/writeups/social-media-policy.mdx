Hey, welcome!
You are probably sent here from a link in my bio, somewhere on the internet.
If you are looking to connect with me, here are a few things you should know:

> \[!NOTE]
> If we’ve met before IRL <span class="muted">
> (or you’ve got my furry business card
> from one of the furry gatherings I also attend)</span>,
> feel free to skip the rest of this page and reach out to me directly.

1. You should be willing to communicate in a language I understand.
   I know Thai, English, and a little of Japanese.
   <span class="muted">You don’t have to be fluent in any of these languages,
   but please make some effort.
   I’d love to get to know all of you.</span>

2. You should identify as a furry,
   or at least be open to learning what it is all about.
   <span class="muted">You don’t have to be a furry yourself,
   but you should show some interest in furry art or fandom.</span>

3. Your social profile must be public.
   There should be enough information about you so I can get to know you better.
   <span class="muted">No locked or discreet profiles, please.</span>

4. Your profile should appear to be run by a real human.
   <span class="muted">Of course your name doesn’t have to be real
   (we are furries, after all).</span>
   But please show that you have a real life outside of the internet
   <span class="muted">(i.e. not terminally online)</span>
   and that you are not a bot.

5. No impersonation.
   **DO NOT** use names that don’t belong to you.
   **DO NOT** steal profile pictures from other furries
   or use images from fictional characters
   <span class="muted">(unless it’s your own art)</span>.

Of course, all other internet etiquette applies.
Everyone expects you to be a decent human being.
In cases where you haven’t got a response, feel free to introduce yourself;
I’ll be happy to chat with you.
