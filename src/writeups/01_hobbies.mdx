## Hobbies and Interests

First, let’s get this out of the way: **I am a furry**

<span class="muted">(yeah, I hope it’s obvious by now)</span>. Furry is my hobby
<span class="muted"> -- *or rather* -- </span>my lifestyle. I’ve created a few
original characters (OCs), but <span class="bole">BOLE</span> is always gonna be
my main fursona.

Speaking of being furry as a hobby,

* **Roleplay?**
  Never tried it. It sounds horribly energy-consuming.
  But I’m always open to that if sufficiently motivated.
* **Art?**
  I’m no good at anything: drawing, painting, sculpting -- I’m hopeless.
  But I adore art and admiring their creators.
  <span class="muted">\**ahem*\*</span>
  That’s why art commissioning exists.
* **Fursuiting?**
  Huge commitment, huge investment, huge logistic and maintenance burden, so no.
  Though I have huge respect for those who pursue this endeavor,
  that they have to do it in scorching heat inside a fursuit.
* **Conventions?**
  Yes! Although I’ve identified as a furry for a long time,
  I attended my first furry convention only recently.
  [See here for past attendance.](#social-gatherings)
  <span class="muted">Hope to see you at the next one!</span>
* **Doujins? Merchandises?**
  I maintain a modest collection of approximately a hundred furry doujinshi
  <span class="muted">(so far)</span>, most of them furry-themed. Other kinds of
  merchandise aren’t really my thing, especially acrylic items. On a different
  note, I’ve helped my [artist friend](https://www.facebook.com/Kalon.Ezhno)
  sell their furry stuff at events like FurSquare 2023 and Infurnity 2023.

### What else?

* I love listening to music and I go to great lengths
  to attend concerts by my favorite musical artists.
  On one occasion, I even traveled to Japan once solely for the concerts.
  In total, I’ve made *four* trips to Japan where concerts were my main purpose of visit.
* Speaking of my musical palette, I’m obsessed with J-Pop, anisongs, and anime soundtracks.
  I can even sometimes identify the music composer of a new anime just by listening!
* Karaoke is my preferred method of practicing Japanese kana -- and
  if you can withstand my horrible singing,
  I know a great Japanese karaoke spot
  <span class="muted">(definitely *not* Man\*\*\*\*eko)</span>.
* I’m a big nerd <span class="muted">(*literally* and *figuratively*)</span>:
  science, technology, linguistics, typography, photography, anime, games,
  quizzes, riddles, brain-teasers, cryptic clues -- you name it.
* Back in 2000s and 2010s, I used to binge a ton of anime.
  Nowadays, I get my weeb fix from just a couple of good shows each season.
* TV game shows are my addiction of choice.
  I’m a huge fan of UK quiz shows like
  [Only Connect](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Only_Connect_\(2\))
  and [The Chase](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/The_Chase),
  or a little more cheeky one like [Taskmaster](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Taskmaster).
  <span class="muted">
    All highly recommended! Definitely check them out on YouTube.
  </span>
* I like to travel abroad and tread on off-beaten paths.
  [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/all-places-in-the-atlas-on-one-map)
  is my preferred Travel Guide.
  I’ve been spending at least one night at the following places
  <span class="muted">(in alphabetical order)</span>: Australia, Bulgaria,
  China, Egypt, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,
  United Kingdom, and United States. I hope to continue exploring as my budget
  allows.
* I’m a dog person <span class="muted">(surprise, surprise)</span>.
  I dream of having a fluffy poodle as my sidekick someday -- no, not a toy one.
