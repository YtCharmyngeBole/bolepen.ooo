## Hobbies and Interests

First, let’s get this out of the way:
I am a furry <Muted>(yeah, I hope it’s obvious by now)</Muted>.
Furry is my hobby -- _or rather_ -- my lifestyle.
I have created a few original characters (OCs),
but <Bole/> is always gonna be my main fursona.

Speaking of being furry as a hobby,

- <Highlight>Roleplay?</Highlight>
  I’ve never tried roleplaying; it sounds horribly energy-consuming.
  Anyways, I’m always open to that if sufficiently motivated.
- <Highlight>Art?</Highlight>
  I’m no artist.
  I can’t draw, paint, sculpt -- I’m hopeless.
  But I adore art and admiring their creators.
  <Muted>\**ahem*\*</Muted> That’s why art commissioning exists.
- <Highlight>Fursuiting?</Highlight>
  I’m not ready to face such a huge commitment yet.
  It is huge investments -- not only the cost of the fursuit itself,
  but also the maintenance and logistics.
  I have huge respect for those who pursue this endeavor.
  And do I need to mention that it’s scorching hot inside a fursuit?
- <Highlight>Conventions?</Highlight>
  Yes! Although I’ve identified as a furry for a long time,
  I attended my first furry convention only recently.
  Furry conventions and events I went so far:
  ThaiTails&nbsp;2023, FurGet&nbsp;2023, Infurnity&nbsp;2023, and ThaiTails&nbsp;2024.
  <Muted>I’m looking forward to attending more conventions in the future.
    Please say hi if you see me there!</Muted>
- <Highlight>Doujins? Merchandises?</Highlight>
  I have a modest collection of approximately
  a hundred doujinshi <Muted>so far</Muted>,
  most of them furry-themed.
  Merchandise isn’t really my thing, especially acrylic items.
  On a different note, I’ve helped my [artist friend](https://www.facebook.com/Kalon.Ezhno)
  sell their furry stuff at events like FurSquare&nbsp;2023 and Infurnity&nbsp;2023.


### What else?

- I love listening to music and I go to great lengths
to attend concerts by my favorite musical artists.
On one occasion, I even traveled to Japan once solely for the concerts.
In total, I’ve made _four_ trips to Japan where concerts were my main purpose of visit.
- Speaking of my musical palette, I’m obsessed with J-Pop, anisongs, and anime soundtracks.
I can even sometimes identify the music composer of a new anime just by listening!
- Karaoke is my preferred method of practicing Japanese kana -- and
if you can withstand my horrible singing, I know a great Japanese karaoke spot
<Muted>(definitely _not_ Man****eko)</Muted>.
- I’m a big nerd, <Muted>_literally_ and _figuratively_</Muted>:
science, technology, linguistics, typography, photography, anime, games,
quizzes, riddles, brain-teasers, cryptic clues -- you name it.
- Back in 2000s and 2010s, I used to binge a ton of anime.
Nowadays, I get my weeb fix from just a couple of good shows each season.
- TV game shows are my addiction of choice.
I’m a huge fan of UK quiz shows like
[Only Connect](http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Only_Connect_(2))
and [The Chase](http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/The_Chase),
or a little more cheeky like [Taskmaster](https://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Taskmaster).
<Muted>You should check them out on YouTube.</Muted>
- I like to travel abroad and tread on off-beaten paths.
[Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/all-places-in-the-atlas-on-one-map)
is my preferred Travel Guide.
I’ve been spending at least one night at the following places
<Muted>(in alphabetical order)</Muted>:
  Australia, Bulgaria, China, Egypt, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Laos,
  Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States.
  I hope to continue exploring as my budget allows.
- I’m a dog person <Muted >(surprise, surprise)< /Muted>.
I dream of having a fluffy poodle as my sidekick someday -- no, not a toy one.
