    First, let’s get this out of the way: I am a furry
    <span class="text-muted-20">(yeah, I hope it’s obvious by now)</span>. Furry
    is my hobby&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;<em>or rather</em
    >&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;my lifestyle. I have created a few original
    characters (OCs), but
    <strong class="font-black text-beetroot-500">BOLE</strong>
    is always gonna be my main fursona.
  </p>
  <p>Speaking of being furry as a hobby,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="subparagraph-head">Roleplay?</span>
      I’ve never tried roleplaying; it sounds very energy-consuming. Anyways, I’m
      always open to that if sufficiently motivated.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="subparagraph-head">Art?</span>
      I’m no artist. I can’t draw, paint, sculpt&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;I’m hopeless.
      But I adore art and admiring their creators.
      <em class="text-muted-20">*ahem*</em> That’s why art commissioning exists.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="subparagraph-head">Fursuiting?</span>
      I’m not ready. It looks likes huge investments&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;not only
      the cost of the fursuit itself, but also the maintenance and logistics. I have
      huge respect for those who pursue this endeavor. And do I need to mention that
      it’s scorching hot inside a fursuit?
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="subparagraph-head">Conventions?</span>
      Yes! Although I’ve been a long-time furry, I attended my first furry convention
      only recently. Furry conventions and events I went so far: ThaiTails&nbsp;2023,
      FurGet&nbsp;2023, Infurnity&nbsp;2023, and ThaiTails&nbsp;2024.
      <span class="text-muted-20">
        I’m looking forward to attending more conventions in the future. So
        please say hi if you see me there!</span

      <!-- TODO: Instead of listing all events here, link to separate sections
                 in MyParticipation section -->
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="subparagraph-head">Doujins and Merchandises?</span>
      I have a collection of about a hundred printed doujinshi
      <span class="text-muted-20">(so far)</span>, most of them furry-themed.
      Merchandise isn't really my thing, especially acrylic items. On a
      different note, I’ve helped my artist&ndash;friend sell their furry stuff
      at events like FurSquare&nbsp;2023 and Infurnity&nbsp;2023.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="text-gray-400">What else?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I love listening to music and I go to great lengths to attend concerts by
      my favorite musical artists. On one occasion, I even traveled to Japan
      once solely for the concerts. In total, I’ve made <em>four</em> trips to Japan
      where concerts were my main purpose of visit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Speaking of my musical palette, I’m obsessed with J-Pop, anisongs, and
      anime soundtracks. I can even sometimes identify the music composer of a
      new anime just by listening!
    </li>
    <li>
      Also, Karaoke is my preferred method of practicing Japanese
      kana&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and if you can withstand my horrible singing, I
      know a great Japanese karaoke spot
      <span class="text-muted-20">(definitely <em>not</em> Manekineko)</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      TV game shows are my addiction of choice. I’m a huge fan of UK quiz shows
      like
      <a href="http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Only_Connect_(2)">Only Connect</a
      > and <a href="http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/The_Chase">The Chase</a>!
      <span class="text-muted-20">You should check them out on YouTube.</span>
    </li>
    <li>To be continued.</li>
