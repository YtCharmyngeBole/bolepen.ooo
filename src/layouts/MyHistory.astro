    His name is <Bole />. Despite being a dog, this auspicious name derives from
    the Middle English word for a young heraldic bull and shares the
    pronunciation of <em>bull</em>.

    For those linguistic inclined, here are some possible IPA transcriptions of
    the word:
    <span class="ipa">/ˈbul(ə)/</span>,
    <span class="ipa">/ˈbuːl(ə)/</span>,
    <span class="ipa">/ˈbɔːl(ə)/</span>&emsp;(see
    <a href={linkToIPATable}>pronunciation guide</a>)
  </p>

    His names holds a little-known story. <Bole /> was born prematurely, his body
    frail and vulnerable to the slightest breeze. The doctor feared that he might
    not survive. Concerned for his well-being, his mother chose a name inspired by
    a bull to bestow strength and courage upon him. And that was how his name came
    to be.
